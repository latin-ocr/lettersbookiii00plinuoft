178 ARTEMIDORVS. BENIGNA. IN MAIVS. [XI 1

XI

To Iulius Genitor. g 1 Artemidorus exaggerates all his
friends’ services, and mine in particular. ς 2 When the philo-
sophers were banished from the city, Ι was at his suburban
villa, being at the time praetor, which enhanced the danger.
Ι also borrowed money to release him from a debt, amid the
mutter-ings of rich and powerful friends who held aloof. ,ξ 3 At
the time seven of my friends had been executed or banished;
scorched by the bolts which feu around me Ι foreboded like ruin
for myself. ξ 4 Yet Ι cannot think that Ι deser-ved glory by my
conduct, but rather escaped shame. §5 For Ι both revered
and (so far as age allowed) loved his father-in-law Musonius,
and attached myself to Artemidorus, when on duty in Syria as
a tribune; indeed my appreciation of him was the first mark
of dawning intellect in me. ἓ 6 Scarce one or two of the pro·
fessed philosophers of the day are so honest, temperate, un-
wearied in labours §7 Yet these are the least of the merite
which led Musonius to choose him (out of a crowd of disciples
of all ranks) as his son-in-law. ξ 8 His only fault (as I began
by saying) is that he values his friends too highly. cf. ep. 1 10
on Euphrates. 11 4 Pliny’s generosity.
