56 CORELLIA HISPVLLA. CORELLIVS RVFVS. [ΠΙ 1

To Corellia Hispulla. ἓ 1 Ι know not whether Ι regarded
your father with greater love or reverence; for his sake and
your own I entertain a special affection for yon. Hence I
must endeavour that your son may take after his grandfather,
on the mother’s side if Ι may choose. Though indeed his
father's father, his father and father's brother, were all men of
mark. ἓ 2 To resemble these examples‚ the boy’s mind must
be steeped in principles of virtue3 and here the choice of a
master is all-important. §3 Hitherto‚ under your roof, he
has been shielded from temptation; now he must be sent from
home; we have to look out for a professor of rhetoric, whose
school bears a. known character for strictness, modesty, above
all chastity. §4 For our stripling, to other endowments of
nature and fortune, adds rare beauty of person: and for that,
in this slippery period of life, we must provide, not merely a
teacher, but a guardian and a governor. ξ 5 What think you
of Iulius Genitor? My love, itself the offspring of judgement,
does not blind my judgement. He is a man faultless and
high-principled3 even, for these libertine times, a little over-
rugged and stern. ξ 6 The world at large can tell of his ora—
torical power, which lies open to the public. Not so the life of
men, with its hidden mazes; here I must be surety for Genitor.
ἓ 7 From his lips your son will learn nothing that were better
unknown. Genitor will remjnd him what a burden of family
greatness he must uphold. Hand him over then, with hea-
ven’s blessing‚ to a teacher, from whom he may learn, first
goodness, then eloquence, which, without goodness, is in
learnt. A parallel letter 11 18.
