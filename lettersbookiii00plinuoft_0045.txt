LIFE OF PLIN Y. xxxvii

methodical to the verge of pedantry¹. Of his writings
the Paneyyric and the Letters alone survive, but
besides his fugitive attempts in verse, he edited a
number of hjs speeches‚ usually revised and elaborated
from the original and published as samples of style long
after their delivery. He was the first too to institute
the practice of publicly reading or reciting specimens
of unedited speeches before gatherings of his friends.
His style, if in oratory over-florid, and even in letters
too often matred by tricks and conceits of rhetoric,
yet posses-ses, like his thought, refinement freedom
and grace, and not unaptly represents the moral linea-
ments of one who, if neither very great nor very wise,
will remain always a figure respectable in endowments,
fascinating in all graces of social life, and loveable in
simple purity of home affections‚ in an age that with-
out its Pliny might seem to have sorely lacked all
such examples². '

This brief memoir can hardly close better than
with the great inscription³ to his memory, which of
old stood graved in marble on the walls of the Ther-
mae which he gave to Comum.

¹ Ep. i. 6, v. 18, ix. 36 and 40.

² For an instructive and most interesting account of Pliny
in relation to his age, of wider scope than is here attempted,
see an article by Mr H. F. Pelham in the Fortniyhtly Review
for February, 1880.

³ The slab subsequently found its way to Milan, and was
broken into six pieces, four of which were built into a tomb
within the great Church of S. Ambrose. Of these fragments
one only sui-vives, but by aid of written records Mommsen has
reconstructed the whole as here given.
