1v (11) 1864 23—37 and a programme by Otto Bernhardt zu
Mus. Rufus, Sorau 1866. Accounts in Schmidt Gesch. d. Denk-
u. Glaubensfreiheit 377-387‚ Brucker, Ritter, esp. Zeller, and
(fullest of all) P. Nieuwland in Peerlkamp pp. 1—137 (the first
work of this famous poet and man of science). The style of M.
is more elegant than that of other Stoics‚ his wisdom more
Socratic. We recognise everywhere the worthy master of
Epiktetus. Yet we have only notes of lectmes, like Xen. mem.
and Epiktet. diss. taken down by some Boswell among his pupils,
probably Valerius Polh'o (Zeller). He has approximations to
Christian doctrines: eg. Stob. fl. IZ=xvn 43 (1 286 9 Μ6111.)
man συγγενέστατον τοῖς θεοῖς τῶν ἐπιγείων. ΡΙΖ = CXVII 8
(IV 88 19) καθόλου δὲ ἅνθρωπος μίμημα μὲν θεοῦ μὸνον τῶν ἐπι-
γείων ἐστίν, ἐκείνῳ δέ παραπλησίας ἔχει τὰς α’ρετάς. Cf. Matt.
v 16. 48. Μ611 need the physician to be saved Plut. coh. ir. 2
p. 453 (one of the ‘ noble sayings ’ of M. which he remembered)
τὸ δεῖν ἀει· θεραπευομένους βιοῦν τοὺς σώζεσθαι μέλλοντας. Gell.
v 1 ἓ 2. cf. Matt. ix 12. He thus consoled himself and an
exile who was complaining of his lot, Stob. fl. M=xn 9 (11
70—75): exile leaves us the elements and the society of men:
true friends will not forsake us; the world is the common
country os mankind3 the good man deems that he is a citizen
of the city of Zeus, comprising gods and men. Exile does not
impede, but aids rather, the pursuit of virtue, for it removes
the distractions of public employments and o'f ceremony: it
made Diogenes a philosopher. Others have gained health‚
being weaned from home luxuries, The brave and industrious
and intelligent satisfy their few wants everywhere. Exile
is no reproach, for was not Aristides the just banished? It is
not exile, but cowardice, that forbids freedom of speech. Dio-
genes was an exile at Athens, was sold as a slave by pirates:
did not he speak freely? I am an exile: they have taken from
me my country, but not my free speech, nor my power of en-
during banishment. Least of all does exile deprive us of the
true goods, bravery, justice, temperame, prudence. If you are
vicious, it is vice that hurts you, not exile. If we are unjustly
banjshed, τῶν ἐξελασάντων τοῦτ’ ἅν εἴη κακόν, οὐχ ἡμέτερον.-
Pliny's generosity to Artemidorus was a mere carrying out of
the rule of M. (Stob. fi. KO=xx1x 78 f.) ἐπὶ χρημάτων μὴ προ-
τιμᾶν τοῦ προΐεσθαι τὸ λαμβάνειν. cf. Acts xx 35. Musonius’
definition of the philosopher was like Cato’s of the orator Stob.
fl. oe=rmx 51 (11193—4): “The law of Zeus commands man
to be good. To be good and to be a philosopher is one and the
same thing. If then by obeying your father you will follow
