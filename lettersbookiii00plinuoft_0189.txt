of one influential defendant, Ι said: ¹ He will be just as inno-
cent, if 1 tell all.’ ξ 26 For the moment Ι have provoked ffl-
will3 but even those who take umbrage at the time, in the
long run admire devotion to duty. ξ 27 But: ‘ why so long a
letter ?’ Do not ask then for news from Rome; nor can a
letter be called long which embraces so many details. §28 Ι
have been no less concise than exact. ⁶ Exact' is rashly said:
I remember something which Ι had left out. You shall have
it though out os order. Homer inverts the order of time, and
many imitate him; for indeed it has a graceful effect: but
I had no such motive. ἓ 29 A witness (whether angry at being
summoned, or bribed to disarm the accusation) accused Norba-
nus Lic. (an envoy and prosecutor) of collusion in the case of
Casta (wife of CL). ξ 30 By law the question of collusion
comes on after the main trial, because-the accusation itself is
the best test of the accuser's good saith. ξ 31 Norbanus how-
ever was shielded neither by the law nor by his office3 a fierce
flame of odium burst out against him as a man of scandalous
character, who had made a harvest of Domitian's rule, and
was on this occasion chosen by the province to prosecute, not
because of hjs merits, but as a foe to CI. who had banished
him. §32 He was forced to plead at once, and did so—say
with assurance or say with resolution—at any rate with great
readiness. ξ 33 The collusion was not what told against him
most. Under Domitian he had joined in the prosecution of
Saluius Liberalis. Sentence: banishment to an island. §34
When accusing Casta, I insisted on this point, that her accuser
had been cast on the charge of collusion. Yet she was ac-
quitted. §35 We sat still, while the case of Norbanus was
going 0n; saying that, if he were convicted‚ we ought to
receive entirely new instructions. Afterwards Norbanus was
praeent at each day's examination, maintaining to the last his
—call it resolution, call it effrontery. ξ 36 Again I had almost
forgotten something. On the last day Saluius Liberalis sternly
rebuked the remaining envoys for not prosecuting all whom
they were charged to prosecute. They were in some risk,
when I came to their aid. §37 This shall be the end of my
epistle, yes, really the end; not a letter more will Ι add.
