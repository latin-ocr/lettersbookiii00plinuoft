136 TRIAL OF CLASSICVS. [VHH

unite the forces 01 the accused‚ 1v) allow the powerful to make
scapegoats of the weak: ἓ 10 for interest and intrigue reign most
supreme under colour 01 strictness. ἓ 11 Mention was made of Ser·
torius who bad his strongest and weakest soldier tug at a horse's
tail :—y0u know the rest. So we, 11 we would master such a host
of defendantS‚ must take them in detail. ς 12 First we resolved
to establish the guilt 01 CL, as the readiest way 01 reaching his
partners and agents, two ringleaders of whom, Baebius Probus
and Fabius Hispanus, we joined with Cl. at the outset. §13 01.
gave us no trouble, having left a note in his own hand 01 bribes
received3 in a letter to a mistress he bragged that he was free
from debt, having netted 4, 000,000s. by selling up a portion 01
the Baetici. ξ 14 Hisp. and Prob. gave more trouble ς Ι had to
prove that agents were personally responsible. ᾗ 15 They did
not deny the facts, but pleaded intimidation; they were not
free agents. ἓ 16 Claudius Restitutus, who replied (a man of
experience and forewarned against surprises) was bewildered
by seeing his own weapons turned against himself. ς 17
Sentence 01 the senate: the property possessed by Cl. before
his governorship to go to his daughter, the rest to his victims:
sums paid to his creditors to be reclaimed. Hisp. and Prob.
5 years' exile. ἓ 18 After a few days we accused Claudius
Fuscus (son-in-law of Cl.) and Stilonius Priscus (a tribune of a.
cohort): the latter was banished for two yearS, the former ac-
quitted. § 19 111 the third pleading we joined in one batch a
number of names, lest the court from surfeit should fail to do
justice; besides the remaining defendants (except the wife 01
Cl. against whom the case was weak) were 01 less importance,
reserved to the last 101· that reason. ἓ 20 As for the daughter
01 CL, who was also charged, there was not so much as a
suspicion against her: so when I came to her name at the end
01 my speech (11 earlier, I might have damaged the force of the
whole) I thought it best not to press hard on her; §21 now
asking the deputation whether they had supplied me with facts
that could be proved against her; now appealing to the senate
whether I ought to use any eloquenee I might possess as a
dagger against the innocent3 I wound up thus: Some one
will say: ‘Are you sitting in judgement then ‘2’ No, but I have
been chosen as pleader from among the judges. § 22 Result:
some acquitted, more condemned, 101· a time or for life. ἓ 23
The senate in passing sentence commended our diligence and
loyalty to our trust. ἓ 24 You may imagine how I am fatigued
with so many set speeches, bickerings‚ examination 01 wit-
nesses. § 25 Efforts 01 the friends 01 the accused on their
behalf: when solicited by some of the very judges on behalf
