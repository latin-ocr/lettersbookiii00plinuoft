7. [[Π1] ORATOR VIR BONVS. MACRINVS. 65

good man (according to Cato's definition 5 1 orator uir bonus
dicendi peritus). ib. 2 5 1 quando autem orator est uir bonus,
is autem citra uirtutem intellegi non potest, uirtus, etiamsi quos-
dam impetus ex natura sumit, tamen perficienda doctrina est:
mores ante omnia oratori studiis erunt excolendi atque omnis
honesti iustique disciplina pertractanda, sine qua nemo nec uir
bonus esse nec dicendi peritus potest. In the remainder of the
ch. he laments the divorce of oratory and philosophy, citing
Cicero’s testimony, dicendi facultatem est: intimis philosophiae
fontibus fluere. ch. 11. 1 pr. 5 18. 11 15 55 1. 33. 16 511. 17

To Macrinus. 5 1 Does my conduct approve itself to you,
as to others? 52 When Ι was in Tuscany with leave of ab·
sence, 'a deputation from Baetica, charged with the prosecu-
tion of Caecilius Classicus, begged the senate to assign me as
their advocate. 5 3 My colleagues pleaded my occupations;
the senate left the decision to me. 5 4 The deputation on my
return entreated me to succour them, as I had done against
Massa Baebius. Hearing the applause of the senators I with-
drew my excuse. 55 Orators of old avenged the wrongs of
private friends: how could Ι neglect the elaims of an entire
people? 5 6 Ι ran great risks in the former trial. The benefit
will be forgotten, is I do not refresh the memory of it by a new
one. 5 7 Besides, Classicus is dead3 so I escape the odium
of endangering a senator. 5 8 Another time, when the accused
may have special claims upon me, it will be more easy to ob-
tain exemption. Freedom is best won by compliance. 5 9
Let me hear your judgement of these motives: frank dis-
approval will please me not less than the weight of your assent.

Macrinus mster accepit: amisit uxorem sinyularis exempli,
etiam si olim fuisset. uixit cum hac triyinta nouem annis sine
iuryio, sine offensa. quam illa reuerentiam marito suo praesti-
tit, cum ipsa summam mereretur! quot quantasque uirtutes ex
diuersis aetatibus sumptas colleyit et miscuit!
