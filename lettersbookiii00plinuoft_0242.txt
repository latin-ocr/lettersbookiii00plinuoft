σοι μᾶλλον ἦ οὔ.” cf. Acts v 29. W'hen Gellius was a student,
a saying of Musonius (Gell. xvr 1 ξ 1) uere atque luculente dic-
tum uerbisque...breuibus et rotundis uinctum, was celebrated
(ἓ 2); ἄν τι πράξῃς καλὸν μετὰ πόνου, ὁ μὲν πόνος οἴχεται, τὸ δὲ
καλὸν μένει· οἷν τι ποιήσῃς αἰσχρὸν μετὰ ἡδονῆς, τὸ μὲν ἡδὺ οἴχεται,
τὸ δέ αἰσχρὸν μένει. Gellius afterwards met with the thought in
the elder Cato.

SOCERVM 131vs many Stoics carried the independence of the
sage so far as to dissuade from maniage. Not so Musonius;
rather he was a warm panegyrist of a union so natural and
morally beneficial, and gives very pure and sound rules for it
(Stob. fi. ΞΖΞ LXVII 20 from his εἰ ἐμπόδιον τῷ φιλοσόφῳ γάμος.

descendant Festus Auienu of Volsinii [also the birth-place of
Musonius Suid.] 1 Festus Musoni soboles prolesque Auieni,

the immoral abenations, which older Stoics had not absolutely
rejected, condemning all unchastity, in or out of wedlock
(Stob. fi. S·=v1 61 ἐκ τῶν περὶ ἀφροδισίων), and also the custom‚
widely spread in antiquity and approved even by Plato and
Aristone, of procuring abortion or exposing children (ib.

is an extract from M. in favour of liberal education for girls
(Stob. IV 212—216 Mein. εἰ παραπλησίως παιδευτέον τὰς θυγα-
τέρας τοῖς υἱοῖς. The virtues of men and women are the same;
a foolish woman is as useless as a foolish man. So he goes
through the four cardinal virtues, and shews that each is as

women ταλασία and οἱκουρία, to men ’γυμναστική and θυραυλία.
As to works however that appertain to virtue, one may rightly
say that these belong equally to both. He goes on to say
(p. 215 repeating 212-3) that chastity belongs to man as to
woman, bravery to woman as to man. No one ever was less
