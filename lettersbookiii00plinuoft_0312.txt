'I'o Cornelius Priscus. 51 Ι am troubled by the death 01·
Martial. He was a man of genius, witty and caustic but good-
natured withal. 5 2 Ι gave him a present when he left Rome,
partly for friendship’s sake, partly to repay complimentary
verses addressed to me. 5 3 It was the fashion of old to re-
ward with public honours or with money those who had sung
the praises of cities or 01 individuals3 but we, no longer per-
forming deeds worth praise, condemn praise itself as foolish.
5 4 You ask, what are the verses which I rewarded; Ι remem-
ber some of them; you must tum to the book for the rest.
55 He bids the Muse visit my house on the Esquiline, but
“ not in the daytime, when he is conning speeches for the cen-
tumuiri, destined to rival Cicero’s in the judgement 01· after
ageS. 'Twill be safer to wait till lamplight3 that is thy hour,
when Bacchus runs riot, when the rose· crown bears sway, and
the hair is dripping with persume. Then even stem Catos
may read me. ” 5 6 Did he not deserve my bounty at parting
and am Ι not bound to mourn his death? He gave me his
best; and would have given more, 11· he could. Yet what can
be given to man greater than glory and immortality? ‘His
writings will not be immortaL’ Perhaps not3 yet not for want
of will.
