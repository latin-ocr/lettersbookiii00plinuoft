xxxiv LIFE OF PLINY.

industry, the ready grasp of detail, the high principle
and breadth of view, which animated the great Em-
peror, surnamed 2⁷}ae Best. Pliny's governorship last-ed
for 15 months or more, and is the last record of his
life3 his death may be vaguely assigned to 113 A.D.,
but on negative evidence only, for all details are
wanting, and it cannot even be said whether 116 died
in his province or shortly after his return to Italy.
Pliny’s physique was far from robust¹. He suffered
at times from his eyes², and had constantly to be on
the watch against overstraining his throat or lungs³:
but he was no valetudinarian, and after years of
pleading and ceaseless official activity still found delight
111 active outdoor recreations. His domestic life was
alwayS, so far as it is revealed, equably happy ; he
married thrice⁴; of his first match nothing is known 3
Domitian was still reigning when he took his second
wife, daughter of the wealthy Pompeia Celerina⁵ and
step-daughter to Vettius Proculus 3 she died 111 97⁶,
leaving him once again without any issue. As some
compensation for this second bereavement Trajan in the
following year conferred on him the ius trium libero-
rum’, and before 105 A.D. he had once more found a
partner in the accomplished and amiable Calpurnia”.

¹ Ep. vii. 1. 5, Χ. 5, x. 11, x, 18.

2 Ep. vii. 21. ³ Ep. ii. 11. 15.

⁴ The notices are tiresomely slight, but I accept Mommsen’s
interpretation of Ep. x, 2 as the best. Most writers maintain
two marriages only. ⁵ Ep. i. 4, iii. 19. 8.

⁶ Or in the closing weeks of 96. Ep. ix. 13. 4.

7 Ep. x. 2. ⁸ Ep. iv. 19.
