xvi LIFE OF PLIN Y.

younger Pliny's mother, who from Misenum first
descried and pointed out to him the phenomena that
heralded the great visitation ,- in two historical letters
his nephew’s pen has preserved the graphio record of
his last hours¹. By the provisions of his will the
elder Pliny constituted his nephew his adopted son;
by strict Roman law adoption, whether testamentary
or otherwise, involved complete assumption of the
name, style and estate of the adoptive father. But
as the more rigid conceptions of the idea of the qens
and the patria potestas evaporated, the legal practice
relaxed: and under the empire, beginning with
Augustus himself, names of the natural, as opposed
to the adoptive, gens and father were with growing
frequency retained. Thus Pliny, who had hitherto
been styled P. Caecilius L. f. Ouf. Secundus becomes

from 79 onwards O. Plinius L. f. Ouf. Caecilius⁹
Secundus, as he is known to the inscriptions and to

history, thus renouncing his old praenomen altogether,
inserting his previous gentile nomen as one member of
a retained but duplicated coqnomen, and adopting as
in duty bound the praenomen and nomen of his
adoptive father. As regards origin, contrary to
antique law even in cases of testamentary adoption,
he retains the style of natural not adopted sonship‚
and presumably no less in the tribal designation‚
though as both his birth-father and adoptive father

² By republican usage Caecilianus must have replaced the
inadmissible Caecilius.
