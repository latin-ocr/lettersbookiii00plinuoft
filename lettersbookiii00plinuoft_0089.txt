To Caluisius. ξ 1 Ι lately paid a visit to Spurinna. May
my old age be like his in its even tenour! ἕ 2 Ι would fain see
human life, especially in old age, move like the stars in their
courses. ln youth a certain disorder may be in place 3 nothing
so becomes the aged as method and rest. ἕ 3 Spurinna observes
this rule in the common round of every-day life. ξ 4 At dawn
he writes on his couch; at the second hour he rises, walks three
miles, conversing the while, or listening to a book. ξ 5 He then
sits down and reads or converses. Next. he drives out with his
wife or a friend3 as lately with me. ἕ 6 His conversation in-
structive, yet unassuming. ξ 7 After a drive of seven miles he
walks one3 then sits down again or returns to his couch and
pen; for he writes both Greek and Latin odes, the sprightliness
of which is enhanced by the author's purity. ξ 8 Before bathing
(in winter at the ninth hour, in summer at the eightb) he walks
naked in the sun, and then takes a. long and brisk game at ball.
After bathing he listens to some light reading. ἓ 9 The dinner
neat and frugal ; the silver plate plain and ancient3 he has a
taste for Corinthia-n bronzes. Recitations of comedies often
enliven the dinner, which even in summer encroaches on the
night, yet no one grudges the time. 5 10 His hale old age.
ς 11 Such a life Ι propose to myself, as soon as years entitle
me to beat a retreat. Meanwhile Ι am harassed by a thousand
occupations3 as indeed was he in earlier 1ife; he has paid dear
for his retirement. ξ 12 Ι propose to myself the same career, the
same goa13 and take you to witness my vow; I charge you to
recall me if 1 do not of myself retire betimes from public life.
