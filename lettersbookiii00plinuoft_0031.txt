LIFE OF PLJN Y. xxiii

nearing its dark and thunderous close, and setting
amid a lurid glare of outrage and debauchery and
plots, Pliny, prompt-ed by mixed disgust and dismay,
shrank into retirement. If he had not the temper of
a martyr or reformor nor could dare the perilous role
of a pretender, neither would he stoop to the intrigues
of a court sycophant. He let others pass him in the
race for fame rather than take those easy cuts to
honour which lay open to the informer and the
profligate. Such at least is his boast 'm the Pane-
gyrio ¹, and in a letter² written some eleven years after
Domitian's death he even intimates that he was
already marked out for death by the minions of the
Emperor. It is safer to believe that adverse personal
influences were ranged against Pliny 3 the Baebius
Massa whom during his praetorship he successfully
prosecuted³ was among the most influential of court
delators, and Metius Carus must have regarded him
with personal animosity 3 their influence may well
have excluded Pliny from consular rank amid the
crowd of applicants whose servility or misdeeds called
for reward. That even after his praetorship he was
not forgotten by Domitian is proved by his tenure
(from 94 to 96 A.D. or 95 to 97 A.D.) of the prae-

1 Pan. 95.

⁸ Ep. vii. 27. The intimation seems altogether slight and
untrustworthy. It occurs casuauy in a letter upon visions and
ghost-stories.

³ Senecio, it may be observed, Pliny’s partner in the pro·
execution, was put to death at an early stage of the Imperial
proscriptione.
