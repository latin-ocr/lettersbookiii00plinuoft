V 1] BAEBIVS MACER. PL. THE ELDER. 77

V

To Baebius Macer. ἕ 1 You ask for a list of my uncle's
books, ξ 2 Take it in order of date. ἓ 3 1 ‘ of throwing the
javelin from horseback‚ 1 book.’ 11 ‘life of Pomponius Se-
cundus, 2 b.' §4 111 ‘wars of Germany, 20 b.’ suggested by
an apparition of Drusus Nero. §5 1v ‘the student, 3 b.' in
six scrolls. v ‘ of ambiguous language, 8 b.’ written in Nero's
last yearS. ἕ 6 VI ‘continuation of Aufidius Bassus, 31 b.’
v11 ‘natural histories, 37 b.’ ξ 7 Yet he was for some time a
pleader‚ he died aet. 56, held important offices and was much
at court. ξ 8 His diligence and early rising. ἕ 9 Before dawn
he went to Vespasian for orders; any spate time was given to
study. §10 After breakfast he lay in the sun taking notes
from a book read to him. ‘no book but can teach something!
ξ 11 Α cold bath. lunch. siesta. At dinner a book was read and
notes taken. ἓ 12 Complained that a friend, by correcting a
reader’s delivery‚ lost him 10 lines. ξ 13 Rose early from din-
ner. § 14 In holiday time always studying, except when actu-
ally in the water. § 15 On his journeys a short-hand writer
always at his side to take notes. ξ 16 Rebuked me for walking,
instead of riding in a sedan. ‘you might have saved these
hours.' §17 Left me 160 note-books full of extraets, written
on both sides 'm very small characters, for a part of which he
had declined an offer of 400,000 sesterces. · ξ 18 He wrote and
read so much, that he would seem to have no time for official
duties; yet considering his incessant studies, you would expect
even more fruit of them. ἕ 19 Men call me studious who am
lazy compared with him; so indeed are students by profession.

ἓ 20 May this letter incite you, not merely to read his books,
but to write like him.
