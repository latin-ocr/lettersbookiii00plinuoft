xiv LIFE OF PLINY.

impression upon him, he looked for guidance to his
mother and his guardian ¹, Verginius Rufus, to whose

higher or manlier influence 3 for Verginius by force
of ability and rect-itude and honest worth held three
consulships and twice in his career refused the
proffered purple, and when in ripe old age he went
down, full of years and honours, to the grave, men
