1. 11 RECIPERATonns 1vnrcus the recuperatores were not a
standing college, but chosen for the special case: originally an
international tribunal, consisting of three (one chosen by each
party, and a third, impartial, by cooptation or by lot) or five
for the settlement of disputed claime between Romans and
foreigners; in later times often employed in cases of extortion
and provincial grievances; at last also in the ordinary course
of justice. As one party often came from a distance, the pro·
cess was summary (Cic. inuent. 11 5 60. p. Tull. 5 10 reci-
peratores dare, utquam primum res iudicaretur. diuin.
in Caecil. 5 56. Gai. 1v 185). The number of witnesses was
limited to 103 the distinction of dies fasti and nefasti was
ignored. Bm Criminalr. 873-7.

fourth legion, and the other a socius naualis, claimed the mural
crown as having been the first to storm New Carthage3 Laelius,
the admiraL took the part of the marine, M. Sempronius Tu·
ditanus of the soldier. The contention was so great that Scipio
appointed reciperatores (C. Laelio et M. Sempronio, aduocati-3
partis utriusque, P. Cornelium de medio adiecit, eosque tres reci-
peratores considere et causam coquoscere iussit). Laelius reporting
that all the sailors and all the soldiers were ready to swear
for their respective champions, Scipio gave crowns to both
claimants. Com-E.
