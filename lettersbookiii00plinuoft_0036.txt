xxviii LIFE OF PLIN Y.

vives as by far the most detailed account of Trajau's
antecedents and of contemporaneous history. It
echoes the universal howl of reprobation that has
made Domitian’s name a bye-word of infamy‚ and
it is nee'dless to add swells the chorus of laudation
that rang from all sides in Trajan's ears.

Into these years, from the accession of Nerva
onwards, falls the series of Pliny's letters, and it
might naturally be expected that materials for his
biography would become adequa'tely complete. But
this is far from the case. Elasson, his most learned
and industrious biographer, after searching investiga-
tion of all the materials at his command, regarded
them as edited simultaneously and out of all chrono-
logical order, and assigned Pliny's Bithynian govern-
orship to the years 103—105 A.D. Nor were these
results disputed until Mommsen’s yet more minute
researches, aided by fuller knowledge of inscrip-
tions, elicited valid indications that the Letters are
roughly¹ though not exactly arranged in chronological

1 Mommsen’s view is that the books are in strictly chrono-
logical order, and the letters within each book usually but not
quite invariably so, though the deviatiom, when they occur, are
but slight. C. Peter, in the Philoloyus for 1873, has strenuously
assailed this position, and in some instances with undeniable
force. The theory of successive publication‚· and the dates
assigned by Mommsen, have not been disproved3 but if they
are correct, Pliny must in some few insta-noes at least have
inserted letters which in actual date of writing preceded the
publication of earlier books: if so Mommsen’s theory, though
it may yield strong presumptions, ceases to be a. certain
