vi ΤΟ THE READER

themselves by neglect of the old folios and quartos, and,
as a natural consequence, the instinct for classical
usage, so finely developed in J. F. Gronov, N. Heinsius,
Bentley, appears to be dying out ¹. I have long thought
that digests of notes, containing in small compass all
that is of permanent value, would be a great boon
to the world of letters. Giovanni Maria Cattaneo
(1506), Gottlieb Kortte (17 34, with notes of Casau-
bon, Barth, Buchner, Scheffer, J. F. GronOV, Chr.
Cellarius cet), J. M. Gesner (1739), G. H. Sch‘afer
(1805), G. Ε. Gierig (1806), Hei-bst (1839), especially
Kortte and Gierig, have done much for the illus-
tration of Pliny, and I retain what is material in
their commentaries. F or the form of notes, even

1 Doring (on 111 9 ἓ 21) retains the reading docuissentne me
aliquid, quod reprobari posse confiderent, rejecting Scheffer's
‘conjecture’ re probari. On ΠΙ 14 ς 2 he says of repente the
adv. ‘von repere) I have several times cited en. as from
Doring‚ but Ι believe that what is new in him is worth1ess, or
is taken without verification from Scheller’s lexicon or other
obvious sources. In particular, nothing short of a positive
assurance of the fact will convince me that he ever opened
‘ Quintil. decl. ’ That book is indeed instructive to the student
of Silver Age Latinity and of the manners of imperial Rome,
but it has found, and deserves to find, few readers in any
age. Bahrens, a most industrious collator of mss.‚ introduces
into texts ⁴ emendations’ which lexicography proves to be cor·
ruptions. Thus in Plin. pan. 24 ς 3 ambulas inter nos non
quasi continyas, he inserts a second non before σοηιίηραε,
which he seems to take asz‘touch.’ Again in Mamertini
gratiarum actio Iuliano 21 (p. 261 14) he coins a new substan-
tive adulatum, where the received reading fucatis adulantium
uenenis has everything in its favour.
