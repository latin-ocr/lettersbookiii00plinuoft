xxiv LIFE OF PLINY.

sectura aerarii militaris, a triennial office that lay
within the Emperor's gift.

Rome breathed again when Domitian felt the
assassin's stroke. Pliny, though untouched in person,
had yet felt the weight of the arch—tyrant's hand in
the misfortunes of not a few associates. He was,
in his own words¹, singed, if not blasted‚ by the
imperial thunderboltS. Moving as 116 did amid the
litei-ary circles of Rome, he counted the most con-
spicuous of the expelled professors and philosophers
among his person-al friends². In prison 01· in exile³
he solaced their depression and supplied their needs 3
when the hour of retribution came, he stood out as
the champion of the wrongs of Helvidius Priscus,
the protector of his widow and the lifelong friend of
his venerable step-mother Fannia*⁸ With the acces-
sion of Nerva came happier times, and the righting
of many wrongs. Prisoners were set at large, phi-
losophers recalled and favourites amerced. Pliny
spread his sails to the breeze by stepping forward
to impeach Publicius Certus, who had been foremost
in levelling the false but fatal charge against Hel-
vidius Priscus. The Emperor stayed 1116 31111, 1)111
1116 63361111 was so far successful 11161 Certus was
superseded in his prefecture and mulcted of a pro-
mised consulship, while Pliny triumphantly published
in a completer form his speech for the occasion under
the title Libri de Helvidii ultione‘.
