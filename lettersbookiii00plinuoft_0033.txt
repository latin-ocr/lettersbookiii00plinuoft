LIFE OF PLIN Y. xxv

Pliny’s appointment as Prefect of the War Trea-
sury lapsed naturally in 96 or 97 A.D. But his
freedom from official cares was short-lived: for early
in 98 Am. he was promoted to the Prefecture of the
Treasury of Saturn¹ ε the appointment seems to have
been a special compliment², for no other instance is
recorded of an individua] passing direct from the
one prefectum to the other. F ully absorbed in his
new functions Pliny renounced advocacy practice,
except in causes celebres, where some public moral
obligation overcame the sense of personal reluctance.
His letters at the time depict him full of business and

ati-‚est his devotion to duty ³.
The death of Nerva after sixteen months of rule,

and the accession of his colleague Trajan as sole em-
peror, served only to confirm or even accelerate the

² The public aerarium was located in the Temple of Saturn.

² Mommsen also claims for Pliny a <inite exceptional four
years tenure of the office, as an additional testimony to his un-
usual efficiency‚ but this claim practically stands or falls with
the chronology assigned to the suits against Marius Priscus
and Caecilius Classicus. The latter of these Mommsen assigns
to September, 101, but this view is very diligently criticised in
the Philologus of 1870 by Η. F. Stobbe, who attempts a re-
arrangement of the chronology in minute detail, and makes
the various stages of the trial extend from September, 99, to
July, 100. The modest candour of the author does not con—
ceal the weaknesses of his case ; his own precise arrangement
is too subtly intricate to take rank as more than very studious
hypothesis3 but in the main issue as between 99 ΑΛ). and
101 A.D.‚ Stobbe’s view (which C. Peter also supports in Philo·
loqus, 1873) seems preferable to Mommsen‘s.
