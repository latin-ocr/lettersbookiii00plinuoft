To Maximus. ξ 1 Ι ask for a friend a favour which I would
readily grant to a friend of yours. ἓ 2 Arrianus Maturus is
the leading man of Altinum—I am not speaking of his wealth,
but of his character and wisdom. ς 3 He is my faithful coun-
sellor in matters of business and of criticism. §4 He loves
me as you do. He has remained content with the status of a
knight. ξ 5 1 wish to surprise him with some not burdensome
preferment. §6 Pray give him the earliest that you have at
your disposaL and neither he nor I will be ungrateful. For
though he does not sue for these things, he is as grateful as if
he were the most ambitious of men.
