To Nepos, g 1 11 13 1101 always 1116 greatest words and
deeds that are most famous. ἕ 2 Witness what Fannia (grand-
daughter of the elder Arria) told me yestcrday of her grand-
mother; matters less known indeed, but not less worthy of fame
than the death-scene. ξ 3 Her husband, Caecina Paetus, and
son, were both ill, mortally as it seemed; the son, of rare
beauty and modesty‚ died. ἕ 4 Arria conducted the funeral
without her husband' s knowledge, cheering him by good reports
of the boy s 1)10g1·ess.§ 5 Tears gushing forth, she went out
to vent her grief and then returned with collected look to her
patient, as if her be1 eavement were left out of doors. §6 There
was a grandem· m the example set to her husband, as she said
on handing to him the dagger: ‘It does not hurt, Paetus.’
But when she stified her grief and acted the mother while her
son was no more, she had no vis-ion of fame to uphold her.
§7 Scribonianus in Illyricum had revolted against Claudius,
Paetus, as an accomplice‚ was convcyed to Rome after the
execution of 1113 chief. §8 Arria begged the soldiers to take
her 011 board that she might serve her husband as a menial.
ἓ 9 When repelled‚ she followed the government ship in a
fishing boat. Before Claudius, when the wife of Scribonianus
offered to give evidence, she cried: ‘Shall I hearken to you, on
whose bosom Scribonianus was slain, and yet you live?' Words
which prove that she long brooded over the purpose of her
glorious death. ἓ 10 11Ἶ1611 Thrasea, her son-in-law, dissuaded
her from suicide, asking: ‘If I am to die, would you have your

daughter die with me?’ ‘’If she replied‘ she shall have lived .

with you as long and 111 311611 harmony, as Ι with Paetus, yes)
ξ 11 Precautions were redoubled; she remarked it, and crying

‘Your labour is in 16111ς you may make me die hard, you
cannot prevent me from dyingst , ς 12 ran full- 1111 with her head
against the wall. When brought round, ‘I told you ' said she ‘that
if you denied me an easy road to death, I would find one how-
ever hard’ ἓ 13 Have I not made good the thesis which 1 laid
down at the outset, greatness and fame are 1101 always pro-
portionate?
