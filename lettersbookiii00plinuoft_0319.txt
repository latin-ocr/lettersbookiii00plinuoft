death) J. A. Schafer cites, as a commentary, Tac. an. 1 20 f.

Wilh. Gemoll de temporum ratione in Plinii epistularum lx
libris obseruata (Halle 1872 pp. 22—24) infers from ep. 15 ξ 1
(petis ut libellos tuos in secessu leyam;...r09as...ut aliquid sub-
siciui temporis studiis meis subtraham cl. 1 13 ξ 6. 11 17 § 29)
that Pl. when he wrote it was at leisure, engrossed in study, in
some vina, and, as there is no mention of commeatus, that he
was no longer in office. He dates it therefore in the summer
of 102; and ep. 18 (cl. ἓ 4 numquam ualde uacat Romae...audire
recitantem) in the autumn of 102, after Pliny‘s return to town:
ep. 13 ξ 1 Pl. sent to Voconius Romanus (A.D. 101) the book in
which he lately returned thanks to the emperor. ep. 18 relates
the recitation (ἓὲ 4, 11) of the speech ‘greatly enlarged.' Now
Pliny’s custom in publication was first to take the advice of a
few friends and then, after considering their criticisms, to give
a more general recitation (vn 17 ἓ 7). Ep. 20 Gemoll assigns
to the beginning of 103 cl. ξ 2 omnes comitiorum die tabellas
postulauerunt, which must have been written shortly after an
election, and (as consularium is not specified) an electiori to the
other offices, and this election took place in January. This
would allow the same date for ep. 21, and 102 for Mart. XII,
and for Martial's death.
