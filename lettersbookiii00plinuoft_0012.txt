THE author, who is now placed before you in our

own lanyuaye, is a most sinyular instance of that
primitive simplicity, that inteqrity of manners, and
that sweetness of disposition, which must render a man
amiable to his contemporaries, and honoured, and
admired by all posterity. H e passed the earlier part qs
his life in sanguinary, suspicions, unsettled times ,· and
he afterwards filled employments of the hiyhest diynity
and power: The latter situation was no less danyerous
than the former. It was open to all the blasts of envy,
rancour, and revenye: yet by the upriyhtness of his
heart, the excellence of his yenius, and the exactness of
his prudence, joined to that proper humility, which is
neither basely servile, nor secretly ambitious, he rode
throuqh the storm in yreat triumph, boldly, prosper-
ously, and unhurt. H is most threatning] hazards pro-
ceeded from his strict friendships, and firm affections
to all those, whom he honoured with his esteem, or
admitted to his boson...

PLINY is not without his blemishes. The critics
determine his stile in yeneral to be too concise, and have
discovered in him yreat marks of vanity, and affecta-
tion. There is, I confess, some foundation for such
censures ,· his metaphors indeed frequently want uni-
formity, and are sometimes inconsistent. But his
beauties, both in literature, and morals, far outweiqh all
his defects.
