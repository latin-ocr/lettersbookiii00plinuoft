LIFE OF PLINY. xxxi

one solitary exception¹ not a sentence that could
wound the susceptibilities of one living] contemporary
has for pungency's sake been spared. Each book must
have been balm to Pliny's correspondents. Yet taken
for what it is, the picture is complete and invaluable.
To resume the course of Pliny's career from the
point at which we digressed. His consulship was as
a matter of course uneventful, except perhaps for the
celebration of the Circensian Games, nor could it
lead to any proconsular mission. The next year,
101 A.D., is noticeable for the loss Roman literature
sustained by the deaths of Silius Italicus and Martial.
To both Pliny devotes a memorial letter², and in the
latter quotes with grateful relish the pretty lines³
of presentation with which the great epigrammatist
had graced his gift to Pliny of his latest volume.
In 103 or 104 A.D. Pliny, now for some time quit of
his prefecture and under the immediate eye of tho
Emperor, who spent the interval between the first
and second Dacian war in Rome, was advaneed to
the augurate¹‚ a common sequel to the consulship,
and two years later received the responsible municipal
post, conferred regularly on a Consular, of curator of
the river Tiber with charge of the channel, the banks
and the city drains. In 106 or 107 A.D. Trajan returned
from his second great Dacian War, and devoted him-
self henceforward to the strenuous economical legis-
lative and administrative reforms, and the princely
series of architectural and engineering achievements
