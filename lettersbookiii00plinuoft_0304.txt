To Messius Maximus. ἓ 1 How hardly, after what struggles,
did the ballot law originally pass. ξ 2 Yet nowg in the senate,
every one claimed the ballot on the day of election. ς 3 In
open voting we had outdone the confusion of the popular
assembly. ξ 4 Crowds of backers on the floor of the house
round their candidates, an utter disregard of the dignity of
the place. ξ 5 Old men's recollection.. The candidate, amidst
perfect silence, spoke for himself ; related his life, appealed to
the general under whom he had sei-ved, to the governor whose
quaestor he had been: they, if possible, or some other ot* his

the senate listened with the staidness of censors. Thus worth
generally prevailed over influence. §7 The excess of intrigue
has led us to adopt silent voting as a remedy3 and the sudden
change made it for the nonce effectual. ξ 8 But I sear that
with publicity the safeguards of upright voting may disappear.
ὅ 9 However: not to anticipate evil: the ballot this time has
provided us with the very best magistmtes3 suddenly as it were
pounced on to pronounce sentence, we have acted as honest
judges. ξ 10 1 send this news because, the fewer opportunities
we have of speaking of politics than our fathers had, the more
eagerly should we seize any tha-t do occur. ξ 11 Let us rise
above the hackneyed ‘How d’ye <10:³³ ‘I hope you’re we11.'
