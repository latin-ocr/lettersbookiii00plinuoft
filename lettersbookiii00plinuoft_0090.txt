1. 7 SPVRINNAM letters to Vestricius Spurinna 111 10. v 17.
A.D. 69 Otho’s general (apparently leyatus legionis) against the
Vitellians (Tac. h. 11 11. 18. 23. 36. Plut. Otho 5. 7), consul
two or three times, perhaps for the third time ΑΛ). 100 (Plin.
pan. 61 quid, quod duos pariter tertio consulatu, duos collegii
tui sanctitate decorasti? The one colleague was Sex. Iulius
Frontinus, who was consul for the second time under Nerua.
So probably Spurinna. He must have been consul before he
was [effatus of Lower Germany, ἵζε. under Domitian3 that on
his return from such successes he received the consulship again,
is nearly certain according to precedent, esp. in this age:
it is also certain that he died after A.D. 100. The second [un-
named] colleague of Trajan is counted among the in toga me-
ritis, ibid.; this suits Sp. who was a poet, at least as well as
Frontinus, and may be reconciled with that military promenade
on the Rhine and the triumphal statue. We know the pro-
minent men of this time far better than we do its ‘pragmatio’
history, and it will hardly be possible to find another who is
not excluded by decisive arguments, while all speaks for Sp.
Accordingly his designation to his second consulship will fall
in ΔΑ). 98, and in the course of that year he must have returned
from Lower Germany to Rome [Mommsen in Hermes 111 40]).
Is at Rome at the end of 96 ΑΛ). 1 5 ἐξ 8 9. When leyatus (imp.
Neruae, as appears) of Lower Germany, the triumphal orna·
