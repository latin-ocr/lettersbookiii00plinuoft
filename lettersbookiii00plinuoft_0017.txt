ante me mea dimit, or have struck out the examples,
simply indicating where they may be seen.

For the text I depend entirely on the critical
edition of H. Keil (Leipz. Teubner 1870), from whom
I reprint such various readings as seem of interest,
either as determining what Pliny wrote, or as fixing
the character of a ms.‚ or for the orthography.
Kortte (or Corte, as he here calls himself) justly
admires the confirmation which conjectural criticism
and the best mss. mutually give and receive (19 ξ 8 11.
raro exemplo, in una, eaque breui epistula, quater
ingenium suum optimo successu aduocarunt uiri
eruditi).

Μι- Rendall deserves the thanks of my readers,
and has greatly increased the interest of this little
book, by writing at my request a short life of Pliny.

undiuaqus (xiv 572, also in Migne patrol. Lxxxvn 366³) is
wholly omitted by Freund and Whjte3 by Klotz, De Vit, LS.
(i.e. Lewis·Short) it is cited from the anthology and from
Corippus. How many words, denounced as ‘post-Aug.’ by
Fremd, have been found in Sall. hist.!
