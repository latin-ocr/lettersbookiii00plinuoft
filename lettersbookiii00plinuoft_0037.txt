LIFE OF PLINY. xxix
sequence, that in publication the separate books suc-
ceeded one another at set intervals, that none of the
letters precede the death of Domitian in September
96 A.D., but that the first book appeared probably
in 97 A.D.‚ the second 100 A.D., the third 101 A.D.,
the fourth 105 A.D., while the rest followed one another
rapidly‚ the latest of the series appearing in 109.
The Bithynian governorship is, in accordance with
this arrangement, postponed to the years 111 to
113 AD. The letters of Pliny, independently of those
addressed to the emperor Trajan, which are collected
in a separate book, do in fact present phenomena
peculiar to themselves. They are not like Cicero's
letters, a living transcript of his thoughts and life, a
revelation οἳ his political schemes and hopes and
disappointments, a confession of every shifting mood
and motive, a key to all his public acts and a dis-
closnre of his innermost domestic secrets, published
after his decease¹ by other hands after the fashion of
modern biographies: they are instead an assortment
of sample letters, selected with scrupulous care by
the author himself, and given to the world, a new
experiment in literature, as models of graceful thought
and refined expression. They present to the reader,
in the utmost fulness and diversity, one side but one

foundation for further historical inferences which depend
solely upon it.

1 True that Cicero knew that Tiro was collecting his
letters, but the knowledge has not affected the mass of them
vitally‚ if at all.
