took office on June 1, and retained their dignity for
a year. On retiring from office on May 31 he had
to submit to the normal intercalated year of non-
official existence, for though already married he could
not like his colleague Calestrius Tiro claim the privi-
lege accorded to the father of three children. It was
on Dec. 10 of the next year that he became tribune;
by special grace of the Emperor he was in J an. 92 A.D.
put in immediate nomination for the Praetorship‚ and
in a month from the natural expiration of his tribunate
in Dec. 92, advanced to the dignity of Praetor for
the year 93 ΑΛ). During his tribunate Pliny felt
constrained to retire altogether from active practice
at the bar3 for the office though in matter of sub-
stantial power the mere phantom of its former self,
yet in Pliny's eyes¹ if not in others' retained certain
external insignia and prerogatives, especially within
the Senate, that made it desii-able for the holder to
avoid anything that could irritate political rivals
or opponentS, or even outside the Curia walls com-
promise his sacrosanct dignity. ‘Repose'2 was the
eulogistic claim Pliny advances as characterising his
own tenure of the office. But in 93 A.D. as Praetor he

did it lead on to a provincial governorship, but it was
signalised by the first great public impeachment in
which Pliny was concerned. In conjunction with
