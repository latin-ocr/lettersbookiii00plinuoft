his master to a post of special confidence. Hitherto, in
the division of provinces into Imperial and Senatorial,
the province of Pontus and Bithynia had lain under
senatorial jurisdiction and been administered by ex-
praetors invested with proconsular power. Trajan
determined to alter this arrangement: the senatorial
control, temporarily or permanently², was abrogated,
and Pliny, selected by Imperial prerogative, was
sentv out to rule the province with the special title of
Legate Propraetor with consular power, a style that
seems to have been continued to his successors. He left
Rome late in July, or possibly in August, and entered
Bithynia in September 3 from this point his correspond-

information of his doings and his whereabouts, and these
letters furnish the completest extant record both of
the details and principles of provincial government,
and of the relations of the governor to the centra] au-

perched on the rocks as its high buskin, while its fellow upon
the low shores he styled‘ Comedy.’

vince, to Hadrian.
