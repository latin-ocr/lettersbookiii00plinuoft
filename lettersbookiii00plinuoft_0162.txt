'I'o Caninius Rufus. ξ 1 Silius Italicus has just starved
himself to death at Naples. §2 An incurable corn was the

cause of his suicide3 otherwise his only great trouble in life»

was the death 01 1115 younger 50ος 1110 elder 15 prosperous and
even a consular. ἕ 3 If under Nero he was suspected 01 com-
ing forward voluntarily as accuser, at the court 01 Vitellius he
had borne himself wisely, and earned renown as proconsul of
Asia. ἓ 4 Η6 lived in the best company, spending much 01
1115 time 011 1115 conch in learned conversation3 his room being
always thronged beyond the rate of his fortune. ξ 5 Η6 wrote
with more pains than genius, and sometimes submitted his
oems to the woild by recitatious. §6 01 1610 116 retired to
Eampam'a, 001 forsook the country even when Trajan first
00101οᾶ Rome as emperor. ξ 7 Τ1161 116 could stay away,
speaks highly 101 Trajan; that 116 1601111οᾶ 10 1150 1115 freedom,
for him. His love 01 art was thought to run even to a mania
101 buying. §8 Having several villas in one neighbourhood,
he would so fall in love with the newest purchase, as to slight
the old: books everywhere, statues, busts; some he worsfflpt,
esp. V irgil' 5, to whose tomb at Naples he went as a pilgrim to
a shrine. ἓ 9 So he lived to be more than 75, being rather
tender of constitution than ailing: the last consul created by
Nero, 116 died last of Ner'o s consuls. ἓ 10 Again the last survivor
of Nero's eonsulars was he in whose consulship Nero died. So
frail is man. ξ 11 It seems but yesterday that Nero was still
alive; and yet no one is now alive who was consul under him.
ἓ 12 Nay more: L. Piso used to say that no senator remained
to whom as consul he had put the question. ξ 13 Well might
Xerxes weep on mustei-ing 1115 11051, 10 think how soon those
many thousands would beo no more. ἓ 14 As our span of life
15 50 fieeffing, let 115 lengthen it, 11 001 by deeds (which may
not be in our power) at least by study3 since to live long] is
denied us, let us 16616 behind 501110 recoid that we have lived.
ἕ 15 True, you need no spur, yet love bids me spur even the
willing horse, as you do me. Generous saise, where friend
incites friend to the love of immortality!
In the ind. are reff. to all passages in Sil. relating to suicide.
For the present take his rendering of that proud ‘consolation’
