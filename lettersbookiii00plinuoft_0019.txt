LIFE² OF PLINY THE YOUNGER.

T the southern extremity of the western fork of
the Lacus Larius, to which it was one day
destined to give its name, lay the thriving provincial
town of Comum; colonised early in the second century
Β. c., it owed its later growth, its Latin franchise, and
eventuassy its full municipal enfranchisement to the
patronage of Julius Caesar 3 from his day, planted on
one highway to the Alps, its prosperity was assured3
in the suburbs, posted on the shores or dotted along
the slopes that shelved gently to the margin of the
lake, were villas and manors of gentlemen of means and
culture and country tastes, while the town itself, proud
of its civic life, its local roll of magnates and its
burgess senate, could point with complacency to its
busy iron foundries and with growing pride to the
municipal edifices—the council-chamber, the public
baths, the library, and even the philanthropic institu-
tions—with which the energy of the citizens or the
local patriotism of hereditary famflies from time to

time adorned it.
² My obligations to Mommsen's article in Hermes for 1869

are so paramount and pervading‚ that I have inserted no re-
ferences in detail.
